I believe better alternatives for passwords exists. Yet, despite countless attempts and to replace them, passwords are used widely. Whether we like it or not, it seems that passwords will be with us for some time.

Password authentication does not excel in user-friendliness and security. It is hard to remember secure passwords. It is almost impossible to remember unique and strong password for every web application.

PassBirds tends to overcome these problems. Not by designing a new authentication protocol, but by enriching our password usage possibilities. This makes it possible to use PassBird on every existing web application.

With PassBird, password authentication becomes as simple as pressing a button on your smartphone. PassBird will replace your password usage experience.
